	<strong>Abstract</strong></div>
<div>
	The last two decades have seen an exponential increase in genomic and biomedical data, which will soon outstrip advances in computing power to perform current methods of analysis. Extracting new science from these massive datasets will require not only faster computers; it will require smarter algorithms. We show how ideas from cutting-edge algorithms, including spectral graph theory and modern data structures, can be used to attack challenges in sequencing, medical genomics and biological networks.</div>

	<strong>Abstract<br />
	</strong></p>
<p>
	The ongoing explosion of new technologies in functional genomics offers the promise of understanding gene function, interactions, and regulation at the systems level. This should enable us to develop comprehensive descriptions of genetic systems of cellular controls, including those whose malfunctioning becomes the basis of genetic disorders, such as cancer, and others whose failure might produce developmental defects in model systems. However, the complexity and scale of human molecular biology make it difficult to integrate this body of data, understand it from a systems level, and apply it to the study of specific pathways or genetic disorders. These challenges are further exacerbated by the biological complexity of metazoans, including diverse biological processes, individual tissue types and cell lineages, and by the increasingly large scale of data in higher organisms. I will describe how we address these challenges through the development of bioinformatics frameworks for the study of gene function and regulation in complex biological systems and through close coupling of these methods with experiments, thereby contributing to understanding of human disease.</p>

	<strong>Abstract<br />
	</strong></div>
<div>
	Enzyme activity is essential for almost all aspects of life. With completely sequenced genomes, the full complement of enzymes in an organism can be defined, and 3D structures have been determined for many enzyme families. Traditionally each enzyme has been studied individually, but as more enzymes are characterised it is now timely to revisit the molecular basis of catalysis, by comparing different enzymes and their mechanisms, and to consider how complex pathways and networks may have evolved. New approaches to understanding enzymes mechanisms and how enzyme families evolve functional diversity will be described.</div>

					<strong>Abstract:<br />
					</strong></div>
				<div>
					Cancer was initially described as a &ldquo;disease of the genes&rdquo; to remark its molecular and genetic character. More recently the concept is evolving towards a definition of cancer as a &ldquo;disease of the pathways&rdquo;. A definition that makes clear the need of involving Bioinformatics and Systems Biology approaches in the analysis of cancer data, a need that is even more obvious when personalize genomic information is considered.
					<div>
						 </div>
					<div>
						In this presentation I will describe some of the possibilities and limitations of the current methods, and I will illustrate them with examples taken from collaboration with pathologists and clinicians. I will make particular emphasis in those areas of Bioinformatics closer to the scientific activity of my group, including: a) analysis of protein binding sites, b) study of splicing variants and c) structural variations, d) comparative pathway analysis and e) extraction of variation-drug-disease relations from text and databases.</div>
					<div>
						 </div>
					<div>
						The experience of the initial personalize-medicine initiatives makes obvious that the problems are larger than the ones that any single group can solve. The goal of my presentation will be to challenge the ISMB community to develop a concerted effort in this direction.</div>

	<strong>Abstract:</strong></div>
<div>
	Acquiring and integrating large-scale, quantitative biological data is a common feature of Systems Biology studies. However, integrating these diverse data and providing additional functional understanding on how cells work and how central processes are regulated remain an important challenge for the field of Systems Biology. A plausible approach to gaining novel biological insights from large-scale data-sets lies in the combined application of these independently developed methodologies in a suitable model organism to the same biological sample, but under different growth and stress conditions. We use Mycoplasma pneumoniae, a human pathogenic bacterium causing atypical pneumonia as model system for our study. Containing a reduced genome with only 690 ORFs, this bacterium is an ideal organism for quantitative, systems-wide studies, avoiding technical limitations due to sample complexity. We report here the metabolomics, transcriptomics and proteomics analysis of this simple organism. Our data shows that even the simplest of the bacteria has a level of complexity that prevents its full quantitative understanding.</div>

		<strong>Biography: </strong></div>
	<div>
		Michael Ashburner (1942-) is Emeritus Professor of Biology at the University of Cambridge and is the former Joint-Head of the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI).<br />
		<br />
		He was educated at the Royal Grammar School, High Wycombe and the University of Cambridge, where he received his undergraduate degree (1964) and Ph.D. (1968), both in genetics. He then went to the California Institute of Technology as a postdoctoral fellow with Hershell Mitchell. In 1979, he returned to the Department of Genetics in Cambridge where he has been based since, as Assistant in Research, University Demonstrator, University Lecturer, Reader in Developmental Biology and Professor (ad hominem) of Biology (since 1991-2011), and now Emeritus (2011-). He has been Miller Professor at the University of California at Berkeley and Visiting Professor at the University of California Medical School, San Francisco; University of Crete, Greece; and University of Pavia, Italy. For the period 1994-2001 he was first Research Coordinator and then Joint-Head of the European Molecular Biology Laboratory - European Bioinformatics Institute at Hinxton, Cambridge. During this period he was on 50% leave from the University of Cambridge.<br />
		<br />
		His major research interests are now the structure and evolution of genomes. Most of his research has been with the model organism Drosophila melanogaster, about which he has written the standard research text (Drosophila: A Laboratory Handbook, Cold Spring Harbor Press, New York, 1989, 2nd ed. 2005). His research has covered a range of subjects, from classical genetics, developmental biology, cytogenetics to evolution, at both molecular and organismal levels. He was a member of the consortium which sequenced the entire genome of this fly (of which he published an account, Won for All: How the Drosophila Genome was Sequenced, Cold Spring Habor Press, New York 2006). He has had a strong interest in the provision of databases for biologists for over 20 years. He was a founder of FlyBase, a major database for researchers using Drosophila as a model organism, a co-founder of the Gene Ontology Consortium (http://www.geneontology.org/), a project to provide infrastructure for biological databases by a defined taxonomy of gene function and of the broader Open Biologocal and Biomedical Ontologies Project (<a href="http://www.obofoundry.org/">http://www.obofoundry.org/</a>).<br />
		<br />
		Ashburner is a Fellow of the Royal Society of London and of the Academia Europeae; he is a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, a member of the European Molecular Biology Organization, and past president of the British Genetics Society. He has honorary doctorates from the Universities of Crete and Edinburgh. He has received the Thomas Hunt Morgan Medal and the George Beadle Medal from the Genetics Society of America, the Mendel Medal from the Czech Academy of Sciences, the Genetics Society Medal from the (British) Genetics Society and the Benjamin Franklin Award of the Bioinformatics Organization. He is a Fellow of Churchill College, Cambridge.</div>
