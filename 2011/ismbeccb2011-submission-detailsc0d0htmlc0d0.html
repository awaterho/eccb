	<strong>Call for Art & Science Exhibition Proposals - ISMB/ECCB 2011</strong></h2>
<p>
	<a href="https://www.iscb.org/submissions/index.php?id=85">**Call for Arts and Science Submission Site*</a> Closed April 15, 2010</p>
<p>
	 </p>
<p>
	<strong>Chair:</strong> Milana Frenkel-Morgenstern, Spanish National Cancer Research Center, Madrid, Spain</p>
<p>
	The Art & Science Exhibition is an event organized by the ISCB Student Council, a student-led section of ISCB whose mission is the development of the next generation of computational biologists.</p>
<p>
	ISMB/ECCB 2011 will bring together scientists from a wide range of disciplines, including biology, medicine, computer science, mathematics and statistics. In these fields we are constantly dealing with information in visual form: from microscope images and photographs of gels to scatter plots, network graphs and phylogenetic trees, structural formulae and protein models to flow diagrams, visual aids for problem-solving are omnipresent. Some of the works of the annual exhibitions at the conference combines outstanding beauty and aesthetics with deep insight that perfectly proves the validity of our approach or goes beyond the problem's solution. Others were surprising and inspiring through the transition from science to art, opening our eyes and minds to reflect on the work that we are undertaking. <br />
	<br />
	For the ISMB/ECCB 2011 Art & Science Exhibition the organizers invite all interested conference attendees (hereafter referred to as "artists") to submit such images and videos ("artworks") that have been generated as part of a research project. They are also soliciting images and videos resulting from creative efforts that involve scientific concepts or employ scientific tools and methods.</p>
<p>
	Participate in this exciting event to surprise and inspire us, to open our eyes and minds.</p>

<p>
	 </p>
<div class="subheading1 style1">
	<strong class="smhead2">Exhibition</strong></div>
<p>
	The Art & Science Exhibition will take place for the duration of conference. Artists are asked to submit images and videos for this exhibition. Videos will be projected in the exhibition space. Images will be shown both in physical form and projected as part of a slide show during the conference breaks. Images from the the exhibition will be displayed in the plenary room prior to the start of plenary talks at ISMB/ECCB.</p>
<p>
	 </p>
<div class="subheading1 style1">
	<strong class="smhead2">Contest</strong></div>
<p>
	Images presented in physical form and videos will automatically enter a contest for a $200 (USD) award unless the artist indicates during the submission process that the work should be excluded from the contest.</p>
<p>
	ISMB/ECCB 2011 delegates will select the winner of the contest through majority vote based on their personal preference. Each delegate will have one vote.</p>
<p>
	 </p>
<div class="subheading1">
	<strong class="smhead2">Submission Guidelines</strong></div>
<p>
	An artist can be an individual or a group of individuals. Each artist may submit video or images for presentation in physical form and projection. The artist has to indicate during submission of images if the image is to be presented in physical form. If the artist submits multiple images for presentation in physical form there is no guarantee that all images will be displayed based on exhibition space. Space for physical presentation of images is limited and will be assigned on a first-come first-served basis.</p>
<p>
	 </p>
<div class="subheading1 style1">
	<strong>Content</strong></div>
<p>
	The artwork may deal with any theme in science but the organizers are particularly interested in work that is reflecting on topics related to Computational and Molecular Biology. While artistic freedom is a primary concern of the organizers the nature of the event requires certain restrictions on the content of the artwork. Artwork that contains sexual, political or religious themes cannot be accepted into the exhibition and will be rejected. Works created for commercial purposes will also be rejected.</p>
<p>
	 </p>
<div class="subheading1 style1">
	<strong>Materials</strong></div>
<p>
	The final artwork has to be submitted for review before the deadline through the online submission system. Together with the artwork a brief description of the work has to be submitted as well as a title for the work. The description must not be longer than 150 words.</p>
<p>
	Videos have to be in MPEG format only and no more than 4 minutes long. The file size of the video must not exceed 100 MB. It must be possible to decode videos with standard software. The maximum resolution for videos is 1024x768 pixels. Videos may include sound.</p>
<p>
	Images to be presented in physical form must be smaller than 43 x 43 (109.2 cm x 109.2 cm). They must not be deeper than 0.5 (1.2 cm) and must be attachable to a poster board using velcro. The organizers recommend to leave a sufficiently wide border around the artwork and to carefully consider the size of photos and the amount of detail included in images. All images must be submitted in their final form and resolution. In case of images employing non-digital media a high-resolution digital photo of the artwork has to be submitted. Images can be submitted in PNG, JPEG, GIF, TIFF or PDF format. The file size must not exceed 25 MB. The conference organizers will print the images for display at the conference. For projection images will be scaled down to a resolution of 1024x768 pixels. The aspect ratio will be maintained. The organizers recommend keeping this in mind when designing images that are submitted for projection only.</p>

<div class="subheading1 style1">
	<strong class="smhead2">Review</strong></div>
<p>
	All submitted artwork will be reviewed for compliance with content restrictions as well as technical requirements. Artwork out of compliance will be rejected. Furthermore, the organizers reserve the right to reject artwork for any reasons.</p>
<p>
	 </p>
<div class="subheading1 style1">
	<strong class="smhead2">Copyrights and Permissions</strong></div>
<p>
	The artist must be holding the copyrights for all parts of the artwork or have permission from the copyright holders to use their works. Copyright holders other than the artist must be attributed accordingly in the abstract accompanying the artwork.</p>
<p>
	By submitting artwork to the Art and Science Exhibition the artist gives permission to the International Society for Computational Biology (ISCB) to display this work and reproductions thereof during ISMB/ECCB  2011 and in materials associated with this and future ISCB events, such as program booklets, (electronic) newsletters, promotional brochures and websites.</p>

	<strong>Highlights Track: About</strong></div>
<p class="style1">
	<br />
	The Highlights Track was introduced at ISMB/ECCB 2007 in Vienna, and immediately ranked as one of the top three events in the popularity, behind Keynotes and Special Sessions. Since its introduction it continues to be one of the most popular conference tracks.</p>
<p class="style1">
	We invite the submission of full papers that have been published, or accepted for publication, between January 1, 2010 and the submission deadline, March 4, 2011. Publications that are "in press" and already linked on the journal web site are also welcome. A group of experts will select the papers to be presented at the meeting considering the impact of the work on the field, the likelihood that the work will make a good presentation, and the relevance to biomedical research, in general. Accepted presenters for the Highlights Track are required to make the presentation themselves, and must register and pay to attend the conference.</p>
<p class="style1">
	Submissions should include a 250-word Scientific Justification (abstract-like argument) that explains how the work of the submitted paper(s) is impacting the field. More details are given below.</p>

	<strong>Highlights Track: Deadline Overview</strong></div>
<div class="style1">
	<br />
	All submissions will be evaluated by a group of editors. Upon submission, the authors will identify the editor/expert most suitable to suitable to review their work.</div>
<p class="style1">
	All papers published in peer-review journals (no book chapters) between January, 2010 and March 4, 2011 are eligible to be presented as talks. Papers in press are acceptable only if already available through the journal web site. Note that presenters are be encouraged to also present more recent work, however, that work will not be considered in the decision. Up to 2 papers can be submitted as one single PDF if the authors intend to present the results of multiple qualifying papers.</p>
<p class="style1">
	The editors will notify authors of the acceptance no later than <strong>Monday, April 4, 2011</strong>.</p>
<p class="style1">
	The selected Highlights will be presented in tracks that run in parallel to the main ISMB/ECCB meeting, July 17-19, 2011. All presentations will have to be completed within 20 minutes and will be followed by 5-minute discussions. While presenters will focus on the chosen paper(s), presentations of more recent results are strongly encouraged. In fact, closed stories that conclude with a particular publication not bearing follow up perspectives might not constitute the best Highlight presentations.<br />

<div class="subheading1 style1">
	<strong>Highlights Track: Review Criteria</strong></div>
<p class="style1">
	<br />
	All submissions will be evaluated by a group of editors to be named, and judged according to the following criteria:</p>
<ol class="style1">
	<li>
		Relevance, interest, and value of the topic to conference attendees,</li>
	<li>
		Impact of the paper(s) on biology/medicine (while the impact of papers on science is not fully reflected by ISI/Google-like impact factors or high number of downloads, high values in such factors will clearly stand as a strong argument for acceptance),</li>
	<li>
		"Presentability" of the work to a large, diverse audience,</li>
	<li>
		Quality of oral presentations by the submitter (if known),</li>
	<li>
		Submissions that permit the presentation of related interesting unpublished new results will be viewed favorably.</li>
</ol>
<p class="style1">
	These "soft" criteria attempt to capture the underlying goal of the Highlights Track, namely the presentation of exciting and thought-provoking seminars that will both contribute to the success of the conference and to the impact the meeting has on advancing computational biology and bioinformatics.<br />

	</strong></div>
<p class="style1">
	PDF files of the papers,  the 250-word Scientific Justification (support abstract) and a 150-word presentation description must be submitted through the automated system by <strong>March 4, 2010 (midnight by any time zone)</strong>. No exceptions will be allowed.</p>
<p class="style1">
	Submissions must be made to the automatic Highlights Track <a href="http://www.iscb.org/submissions/index.php?id=81" target="_blank">Submissions Site</a>.<br />
	Submissions should include the following:</p>
<ul class="style1">
	<li>
		For each presenter only one submission to the Highlights Track will be reviewed (the LAST will be taken by default). The same limitation applies for the last author (group). Publications can be grouped if it becomes clear how different publications will be combined in a talk. The maximal number of submissions per author/co-author is 5.</li>
	<li>
		Name/affiliation/email of submitter (assumed to be the presenter; note that the presenter cannot be changed because the identity and ability to present of that person will be an essential selection criterion).</li>
	<li>
		Names/affiliations/email of ALL coauthors (note: any name appearing on a published paper has to be added here). Note that all co-authors have to agree to the submission. It is the responsibility of the submitter to guarantee that all co-author email addresses are correct (email notifications of the submission will be sent to all co-authors).</li>
	<li>
		150  word description of the presentation for promotion on conference website.</li>
	<li>
		Additional contact information (for presenter).</li>
	<li>
		250-word limited abstract-like argument that explains the impact and importance of this work.</li>
	<li>
		Sources of original publication(s) (Year, Journal, Vol., pages).</li>
	<li>
		PDF with paper(s) (note: in case of the submission of 2 papers, both should be merged into one single PDF; all reviews will be based on the content of this PDF).</li>
	<li>
		Optional: link to Google Video demonstrating presentation skills of presenter.</li>
	<li>
		Only PDF submissions are acceptable. The submission system is currently unable to handle ASCII, Word, LaTeX, or anything other than standard PDF. It is the responsibility of the submitter to verify that the PDF is completely viewable/printable by all major operating systems (LINUX, MacOS, Windows).</li>

	<strong>Submission Guidelines</strong></div>
<p class="style1">
	Papers will be assigned to an Area and three reviews sought. Accepted papers will be published as conference proceedings in an open access, online-only, section of a regular issue of the Bioinformatics journal with an electronic version distributed to conference delegates. The proceedings will be available online approximately one month prior to the conference opening.</p>
<p class="style1">
	 </p>
<p class="style1">
	Publication of the proceedings as an online part of the Bioinformatics journal will result in fully citable articles, indexed by Medline and ISI. See the conference proceedings for <a href="http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/26/12.toc">ISMB 2010</a> for an example of online-only publication by Oxford University Press.<br />
	<br />
	Presenters of accepted papers will be given a 20-minute time slot (plus 5 minutes for questions) in the conference schedule to provide a summary and update to their work.<br />
	<br />
	Papers can be submitted in either a template-free format or in the format following the template for author submission to the OUP journal bioinformatics. If the OUP template is used the paper length must not exceed nine pages. If the template-free format is used the length of the paper must not exceed 12 pages (single space, 12 point font), including abstract, figures, tables, and bibliography. In either case, the paper must contain an abstract whose length does not exceed 250 words.<br />
	<br />
	After acceptance papers will have to be formatted according to the layout style required by the OUP bioinformatics journal and will be limited to 9 pages. Formatting requirements can be found at: <a href="http://www.oxfordjournals.org/bioinformatics/for_authors/submission_online.html">http://www.oxfordjournals.org/bioinformatics/for_authors/submission_online.html</a> <br />
	<br />
	If absolutely necessary, submissions can be accompanied by supplementary material, similar to submissions to scientific journals. The supplementary material should be collected in a separate file that is appropriately marked and uploaded as an attachment on the paper submission page in EasyChair. However, we advise against adding supplementary material, in general. Supplementary material will be published on the proceedings site alongside the online version of the conference paper. We do not support supplementary material presented at any other than the publisher's site. Additionally, OUP does not edit or typeset supplementary data - it is uploaded online exactly as it is received, so authors must ensure its accuracy before submitting. <br />
	<br />
	Papers should be submitted in their final form since the evaluation procedure does not allow for additional rounds of refinement / modification in response to referee criticisms. Poor quality submissions or insufficiently prepared papers are very often rejected. Paper presenters must register and pay to attend and present at the conference.<br />
	<br />
	<strong>PAPERS NOT CONFORMING TO THESE GUIDELINES WILL BE RETURNED WITHOUT REVIEW.</strong> <br />
	<br />
	<br />
	Papers submitted for review should represent original, previously unpublished work. At the time the paper is submitted to ISMB/ECCB 2011, and for the entire review period, the paper should not be under review by any other conference or scientific journal.<br />
	<br />
	Papers will be accepted electronically, in PDF format only, at the <a href="http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ismbeccb2011" target="_blank">submission site</a> until <strong>Friday, January 14, 2011</strong>. (You have until 11.59 p.m. in the time zone of your choice. This means that the submission server will be closed at noon, 11:59 am GMT (UTC+0), January 15, 2011).</p>
<p class="style1">
	<br />
	Notification of conditional acceptance will be provided by e-mail no later than <strong>Monday, March 14, 2011</strong>. Final, corrected versions of accepted papers, which must conform to the formatting guidelines available when the paper is accepted, are due no later than <strong>March 28, 2011</strong>. Details of the submission process and format of accepted papers will be provided at the time of paper acceptance.</p>
<p class="style1">
	Papers not accepted may be resubmitted as a "regular conference poster" until <b>Friday</b>, <strong>March 18, 2011</strong> or as a "late conference poster" until <b>Monday, </b><strong>April 18, 2011.</strong> Poster information is available <a href="http://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2011-submission-details/call-for-posters">here</a>.</p>

	<strong>Call for Special Sessions Proposals - ISMB/ECCB 2011</strong></h2>
<p>
	<strong>Special Session Chair:</strong> Michal Linial, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel</p>
<p class="style1">
	<a href="https://www.iscb.org/submissions/index.php?id=76">** Special Sessions Submissions</a> - Closed</p>
<p class="style1">
	<strong class="smhead1"><br />
	ISMB/ECCB 2011</strong> will feature a <em>Special Sessions</em> track that will run throughout the conference in parallel to other tracks (except the keynote presentations). In its structure, each <em>Special Session</em> provide for a more in-depth look at the subject matter presented. Proposals for special sessions should be submitted via the online submission system at <a href="http://www.iscb.org/submissions/index.php?id=76">here</a> prior to October 22, 2010. <br />
	<em><br />
	Special Sessions</em> have the purpose of introducing the ISMB/ECCB community to relevant 'hot' topics that were not covered in previous meetings. A wide range of topics are possible, as long as they importantly influence computational biology and bioinformatics. They might, for example, cover emerging themes that ISMB and ECCB are not currently approaching with the desired proficiency. We encourage you to submit a proposal on an area that in your eyes is important to the computational biology community and may impact the future of the field.<br />
	<br />
	<em>Special Sessions</em> were introduced at ISMB/ECCB 2007 and since this time have become one of the most successful components of this conference.</p>
<p class="container">
	<br />
	This call is an invitation for scientists and professionals to submit proposals for special sessions for<strong> </strong><strong class="smhead1">ISMB/ECCB 2011</strong>, to take place in Vienna, Austria, between the dates of July 17 - 19<strong>.</strong></p>

	<em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Technical instructions:</strong> </span></em><br />
	<em>Special sessions</em> run the same schedule as all other parallel tracks. They <u>MUST</u> be designed as half-day sessions (2 hours) and synchronized with other tracks. The regular presentation unit is 30 minutes consisting of  20 minute talks + 5 minute discussion + 5 minutes for movement between parallel tracks. Sessions may include any form of presentation such as talks or panel discussions.</p>
<p class="style1">
	Preference will be given to emerging fields and to related fields in which the ISMB/ECCB community needs to acquire higher proficiency. Special sessions are expected to provide a broad perspective on an emerging research field. Sessions will be selected from the submissions to this open call. Potential fields of interest include metabolomics, epigenetics and imaging. Additional topics of particular interest to the ISMB/ECCB community are welcome. <br />
	<br />
	Proposals for special sessions should be submitted via the online submission system <a href="https://www.iscb.org/submissions/index.php?id=76">here</a> prior to <strong>October 22, 2010</strong>. <br />
	<br />
	<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>How to submit:</strong></span> Submissions <strong>must</strong> include a one-page description of the field, its relevance to the ISMB community, and the reasons for planning a session on this topic at ISMB/ECCB 2011. Submitters may want to briefly describe their qualification to organize the Special Session. These explanations could be followed by a list of topics for possible presentations with one-paragraph descriptions. Finally, a draft of the time schedule for the session should be presented. A finalized list of speaker names is not necessary but may add weight to the proposal. If you list invited speakers as "accepted", please make sure that they agree to speak given to the financial constraints describe below. <br />
	<br />
	<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Financial constraints</span>:</strong><em> Special Sessions</em> are an integral part of the ISMB meeting. <em>Special Sessions</em> chairs and speakers <u><strong>MUST</strong></u> pay their expenses including registration to the meeting. Therefore, the organizers highly encourage session organizers to seek independent funding, and to include any commitment that they may have secured in the proposal. ISMB/ECCB will help in the administrative aspects of assigning the rooms, announcements and adding the detailed schedule to the conference program.

	<strong>Call for Special Interest Groups Proposals - ISMB/ECCB 2011</strong></h2>

<div class="style1">
	<b><br />
	</b> We invite you to submit a proposal to organize a Special Interest Group (SIG) meeting at the ISMB/ECCB 2011 conference, which will be held at the Austria Center Vienna, July 15 - 16, 2011.<br />
	<br />
	Special Interest Group Meeting (SIGs) submissions should be submitted via the online submission system <a href="https://www.iscb.org/submissions/index.php?id=80">here</a> prior to October 8, 2010.<br />

		<strong><a name="what">What is a SIG meeting?</a></strong></div>
	<p class="style1">
		A SIG meeting is a one- or two-day focused workshop. It should provide a broad and/or deep perspective on developments in a field of research, and is intended as a way to address a topic more extensively than can be done in the main conference.</p>
	<p>
		Follow these links to see examples of previous SIG meetings:</p>
	<a href="http://www.iscb.org/ismb2010-program/satellite-meetings">ISMB 2010 (Boston)</a><a href="http://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2009/sigs.php" target="_blank"><br />
	ISMB/ECCB 2009 (Stockholm)</a><br />
	<a href="http://www.iscb.org/ismb2008/sigs.php" target="_blank">ISMB 2008 (Toronto)</a><br />
	<br />
	A Satellite Meeting is similar to a SIG meeting but has logistical or financial needs that do not fit conveniently into the SIG structure. Satellite Meeting proposals will be considered along with SIG proposals. SIG delegates will not be able to attend Satellite Meeting sessions and vice versa, and handout materials will be separate as well.</div>

		<strong>Logistical considerations</strong></div>
	<p class="style1">
		SIG meetings will be held during the two days prior to the main conference: Friday and Saturday, July 15 and July 16. On the first day, SIGs will be held in parallel with the Student Council Symposium; on the second day, with tutorials. Participants will register for a primary SIG and will be free to circulate between parallel sessions only on the day of the meeting(s) they are registered for.<br />
		<br />
		Proposals should indicate a preference for which days its meeting will be held if submitting a one-day only proposal; the organizers will try to respect these preferences but do not guarantee that all SIGs will receive their preferences.</p>
	<div class="subheading1">
		<strong>Responsibilities of SIG organizers and ISCB / ISMB</strong></div>
	<p class="style1">
		SIG organizers are responsible for the scientific content of the SIG meeting. They may invite speakers, publish a call for submissions, or use a combination. They are expected to operate within the context of ISMB/ECCB procedures, including finalizing the program and providing materials by the deadlines, working within the budget, etc.<br />
		<br />
		Delegates to all SIG meetings will receive handouts from all SIG meetings, to facilitate movement between sessions. The handouts may be available in electronic form and/or printed form - this will be confirmed at a later date. <br />
		<br />
		Organizers will collect and prepare handout materials. They are responsible for ensuring that the material that they submit may be legally used and that appropriate copyright permissions have been arranged. Speakers are expected to grant permission to ISMB to copy and distribute these materials, including making them available for sale.<br />
		<br />
		SIG organizers should consider hosting and maintaining a SIG website.<br />
		<br />
		Please pay particular attention to the deadlines for submitting the program of speakers and the handout materials (in electronic form). SIG participation is much more effective when delegates can view the schedules on the web ahead of the meeting and when they receive the handouts from all SIGs together.<br />
		<br />
		ISCB will handle the logistics of holding the SIG meeting in conjunction with ISMB/ECCB 2011 and will take the financial risk for holding the meeting. This includes managing registration, promoting the meeting, preparing delegate handouts from the provided materials, providing a room and audio-visual services (Internet access, projector & screen, microphones, etc.), and supplying food and beverages for breaks and lunches.<br />
		<br />
		Please review the <a href="http://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2007/wp-content/uploads/2006/10/iscb-sig-relation-v12.pdf" target="_blank">ISCB/SIG Relationship document</a> for more detailed information.</p>

	<div class="subheading1">
		<strong>How to apply</strong></div>
	<p class="style1">
		Please include the following sections in your proposal, in the indicated order. The entire proposal should be no more than four pages long.</p>
	<ol type="1">
		<li>
			Title (up to 20 words, preferably worded to pique delegates' interest)</li>
		<li>
			Topic: Describe the field to be covered by the SIG meeting and its relevance for conference participants (about one page)</li>
		<li>
			Meeting details
			<ol type="a">
				<li>
					Duration (1 or 2 days)</li>
				<li>
					Indicate a preference for which meeting day is preferred if submitting a one-day only proposal (indicate if it does not matter)</li>
				<li>
					Expected sessions / topics, if possible with an explanatory paragraph about each</li>
				<li>
					Draft of time schedule for the day(s) of the meeting</li>
				<li>
					How presentations will be selected (invitation, call for submissions, etc.)</li>
				<li>
					Possible speakers (This is not required, but may add weight to the proposal-indicate speakers who have already agreed to participate.)</li>
				<li>
					Previous meetings of this or related SIGs, with attendance statistics</li>
				<li>
					List of special requests not covered in the ISCB/SIG Relationship document referenced above, noting if any request is essential to conducting the meeting (ISCB will try to be accommodating but cannot guarantee to supply specially-requested items). A Satellite Meeting proposal should explain why the meeting should be held as a Satellite Meeting instead of as a SIG.</li>
				<li>
					Potential sources of sponsorship for the meeting</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
		<li>
			Information about organizers: For each organizer, include full name (including title), affiliation, e-mail and postal addresses, telephone numbers (work and cell, if available, including country and city codes), fax number, URL of home page, qualifications to organize this meeting</li>
	</ol>
	<p class="style1">
		Proposals should be submitted in Acrobat (.pdf) format. Name the file using the family name of the first organizer (i.e., John Doe's proposal should be in a file named doe.pdf).</p>
	<p>
		Submit proposals <a href="https://www.iscb.org/submissions/index.php?id=80">online</a> by Friday, October 8, 2010</p>

			<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Helvetica; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;"><span style="font: small Helvetica;">SIGs that have had a solid record for each of the previous three years may submit a letter of intent instead of a full proposal.

It should indicate that the organizers plan to organize the meeting for the upcoming ISMB/ECCB and should include the organizing committee contact details. </span></span></div>

		<div style="margin: 0px;">
			<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Helvetica; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;"><span style="font: small Helvetica;">A full proposal should be submitted if the organizers plan substantive changes to the previous year's proposal (e.g., focus, number of days, special requests) or if the organizing team has changed substantially. Furthermore, a letter of intent may be used in at most two consecutive years; every third year, at least, a full proposal is required.</span></span></div>

		<div style="margin: 0px;">
			<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Helvetica; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;"><span style="font: small Helvetica;">A solid record means that the SIG has had good, consistent or increasing attendance (taking into account problems that affect overall conference attendance) and has at least broken even financially in each previous year. It also means that the organization was carried out smoothly, including timely submission of materials according to the published schedule.</span></span></div>
