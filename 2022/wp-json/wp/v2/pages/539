As a statement of principle, ECCB2022 rejects discrimination and harassment by any means, based on factors such as ethnic or national origin, race, religion, citizenship, language, political or other opinion, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, pregnancy, age or socio-economic class.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moreover, ECCB2022 opposes all forms of bullying including threatening, humiliating, coercive or intimidating conduct that causes harm to, interferes with or sabotages scientific activity and careers. Discrimination, harassment and mobbing create a hostile environment that reduces the quality, integrity, and pace of the advancement of science by marginalising individuals and communities. It also damages productivity and career advancement, and prevents the healthy exchange of ideas.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ECCB2022 Organising Committee is committed to supporting a productive and safe environment for all who are participating in the ECCB2022, both the main conference and all its satellite and social activities, maintaining an inclusive environment where people value diversity and foster dignity and respect to everyone.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-stackable-heading stk-block-heading stk-block stk-a0a95b9\" data-block-id=\"a0a95b9\"><style>.stk-a0a95b9 .stk-block-heading__bottom-line{height:1px !important;width:100% !important;background-color:var(--paletteColor4,#0081a7) !important;margin-top:20px !important}<\/style><h2 class=\"stk-block-heading__text\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\"><span style=\"color: var(--paletteColor4, #0081a7);\" class=\"stk-highlight\">Expected behaviour<\/span><\/h2><div class=\"stk-block-heading__bottom-line\"><\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>All participants in the ECCB2022 are expected to show respect and courtesy to others.
