Computational biology has been a key instrument to help our societies in findinding solutions to the current health crisis and emerge stronger from it. Spaces like the ECCB2022 are essential to promote the scientific debates and collaborations that contribute to moving the field forward.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The four-day conference will offer a number of top keynote speakers, insightful talks selected from delegates submissions, onsite poster sessions and an exhibition for institutions and companies. The programme will feature a new track on \u201cClimate Crisis and Health\u201d, which complements the traditional themed tracks. In the week prior to the main conference, delegates will be invited to join the <strong>New Trends in Bioinformatics by ECCB<\/strong>, a program to host a selection of virtual and face-to-face workshops and tutorials.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>ECCB2022 welcomes scientists working in a variety of disciplines, including bioinformatics, computational biology, systems biology, artificial intelligence, biology, medicine and environmental sciences. Participating in ECCB2022 will be a unique opportunity to keep pace with cutting edge research while interacting with a diverse and broad representation of the research community across many domains in Life Sciences and beyond. We are sure that the conference will facilitate knowledge dissemination of great interest and vivid scientific discussions, as well as stimulating a creative exchange of ideas.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We look forward to meeting you in person again in the unique scenery of Sitges!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With best regards,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"color: var(--paletteColor4, #0081a7);\" class=\"stk-highlight\">Alfonso Valencia and Salvador Capella-Gutierrez on behalf of the ECCB2022<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div><\/div><\/div>\n<\/div><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Spanish National Bioinformatics Institute (INB\/ELIXIR-ES) and the Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC) welcome you to the city of Sitges (Barcelona, Spain) to participate in the 21st European Conference on Computational Biology (ECCB2022) under the motto Planetary Health and Biodiversity.
