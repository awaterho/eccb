    <b>Abstract:</b><br>
    Interleukin-21 (IL-21) participates in the transition from innate to adaptive immunity, and facilitates tumor eradication in vivo. To study the prospects of IL-21 as an immunotherapeutic agent, cancer-immune system interactions were mathematically modeled, focusing on IL-21-mediated NK/CTL effects. The model retrieved murine melanoma and fibrosarcoma growth dynamics from various experiments. Computer simulations suggest that, in non-immunogenic malignancies, clinical use of IL-21 should include a tumor mass-dependent therapeutic strategy, faithfully amplifying the natural anticancer immunity.

    <b>Abstract:</b><br>
    In V(D)J recombination, CDR3 lengths are distributed almost normally. Is this just due to stochasticity, or has rearrangement been evolutionarily optimized? Using a simulation of all DNA modifications included in gene rearrangement, we suggest that specific biases govern the rearrangement process, and that V(D)J recombination parameters most likely reflect the optimal conditions under which rearrangement occurs. We also found that identical rearrangements of the heavy chain are highly unlikely to occur within one human lifetime, for the light chain this probability is not negligible.

    <b>Abstract:</b><br>
    The present study was to investigate the effect of DPP-esters (DPP-OR), with various hydrophobic R groups, on tyrosinase activity. New derivatives of DPPacid were synthesized, methyl, ethyl, isopropyl and octyl forming DPP-esters (DPP-OR), and their inhibitory effect was tested. Structure-activity relationship studies were performed using the Autodock program to calculate docking parameters related to the interaction between tyrosinase and its potential inhibitors.

    <b>Abstract:</b><br>
    TRAMP is a genetically engineered mouse model that mimics the pathology of clinical prostate cancer [Greenberg 2003]. We use TRAMP to determine if the ability to determine at diagnosis which patient will develop or already has progressed to disseminated disease will significantly impact the clinical management of cancer. We observed heterogeneity between TRAMP strains and amongst individual mice in time of tumor appearance, cancer progression rate, and time of metastases appearance. These pathological observations are interesting since the oncogenic signal in inbred TRAMP mice initiates cancer at a similar time.
