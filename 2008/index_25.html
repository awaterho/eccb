Situated in the middle of the Mediterranean Sea, Sardinia with its app. 1,800 kilometres of coastline, is one of the most popular destinations for people who loves aquatic sports and seaside holidays, not only for its natural beauty and geographical position but also for its history. The sea around this large Mediterranean Island (second only to Sicily in size among all Mediterranean Islands) is among the most beautiful and transparent in all of the world. D.H. Lawrence in his famous book 'Sea and Sardinia' wrote that Sardinia was a land like no other. Sardinia is also a land rich of history an cluture witnesses. The numerous &quot;nuraghi&quot; which are spread all over the island, occupy a very relevant place among the archeological sites that have been left in the Western Mediterranean basin by the various cultures which have, over the centuries, lived in these lands. These majestic buildings have a prominent role in the Sardinian landscape so much so that they remain stamped on the visitor's mind as a characteristic image of this mysterious and extraordinary land and are a symbol and emblem of a whole population.<br />
Its capital is Cagliari, located in the Southern part of the island. <br />

<div align="left"> <strong>Climate</strong> <br />
<br />
The climate in Sardinia is typically Mediterranean and the influences of the sea are present all around the island. It is characterized by long, warm summers and short, mild winters, accompanied by the blowing of the north-west wind<br />
The average temperature in September is 27 degrees Celsius (81 Farenheit) with an average precipitation of 31 mm (1.2 in).<br />
<br />
<strong>A bit of history ...</strong><br />
<br />
Sardinia's history dates back to <strong>150,000 BC</strong>. In Prehistory Sardinia's inhabitants developed commercial relationships with most of the Mediterranean inhabitants. From the Neolithic Period until the Roman Empire, the island hosted the Nuragic civilization. Nowadays, there are still thousand of Nuraghes living there. <br />
<br />
The Phoenicians established colonies around modern-day Cagliari three thousands year ago. <strong>In 509 BC</strong>, the natives and the Phoenician settlers were at war. The settlers asked Carthage for help and later the island became a province in the Carthaginian Empire. In <strong>238 BC</strong>, Carthage ceded Sardinia to Rome. The Romans enlarged the coastal cities and ended the Nuragic civilization.<br />
<br />
Julius Caesar declared it a Roman municipality in 46 BC, but with the fall of Rome's power times became difficult and, in <strong>456</strong>, the Vandals occupied the coastal cities of Sardinia. The island was reconquered by the Byzantine Emperor Justinian I and divided into districts called &quot; mereie&quot;. Christianity started to spread, except in the Barbagia region, where by the end of 500 an independent kingdom started to rule. <br />
<br />
When, in <strong>827,</strong> the Arabs started raiding Sicily, Sardinia was left alone to defend itself. The &quot;judex provinciae&quot; became its supreme leader, with civil and military powers. The island was divided into four districts: Gallura, Logudoro, Arborea, and Cagliari. In a few decades, these districts became fully independent monarchies.<br />
<br />
The emerging rival sea powers of Genoa and Pisa started getting interest in the island. In <strong>1258</strong> the Pisans took Cagliari, fortified the Castello area and replaced the local population with Pisans. <br />
<br />
In <strong>1323</strong>, the Kingdom of Aragon tried to conquer Sardinia. The last district to be defeated in the Battle of Sanluri in <strong>1409</strong> was Arborea. The native population of Alghero was expelled and the city repopulated by the Catalans, whose descendants still speak Catalan. <br />
<br />
In <strong>1479</strong>, the Kingdom of Spain was born, the Catalans themselves were subordinated to the Spaniards and the Kingdom of Sardinia remained as a part of Spain during 400 years, until 1720. In <strong>1620</strong> the city's university opened its doors.;br /&gt; <br />
Many spanish traditions can still be recognized today in the traditional processions of S. Efisio in Cagliari (May 1st), the &quot;Cavalcata&quot; in Sassari (in May) and the &quot;Redentore&quot; in Nuoro (August 29th). In <strong>1708</strong>, after the Spanish War of Succession, the government of Sardinia was ceded to the Austrians.<br />
<br />
In <strong>1717</strong> Spain occupied Sardinia again and one year later, with the Treaty of London, Sardinia was ceded to the Duchy of Savoy, princes of Piemonte. The Kingdom of Sardinia became Italian. <br />
<br />
The first street lighting appeared in <strong>1811</strong> and a regular postal service with Genoa was established in 1835. King Carlo Felice built a modern highway to Sassari that still bears his name today. <br />
<br />
In <strong>1848</strong> the italian Independence wars started and Italy became one. They were carried out by the Sardinian Kings during 13 years. In 1861, the Kingdom of Sardinia became Kingdom of Italy and the Italian State was born. In <strong>1946</strong>, with the popular referendum, Italian became a Republic. Nowadays, Sardinia is one of the twenty Italian regions.<br />
<br />
Cagliari was heavily bombed in WWII, and in <strong>1948</strong> the city was awarded a medal for the bravery of its people. <br />
<br />
One of the most important postwar successes was the elimination of malaria from the Sardinian coast in the <strong>1950s</strong> - this allowed the development of coastal tourism that today forms a pillar of Sardinia's economy.<br />
<br />
Nowadays, there is a delicate balance to be struck between modernisation and preserving the island's unique native character. Luckily, there has been renewed interest in and appreciation of traditional Sard culture and artisanship, which were repressed for so many centuries.<br />
<br />
<strong>Food</strong> <br />
<br />
Sardinia is one of the favourite destinations of also for its rich gastronomy based on ancient recipes. Its vegetation has stimulating scents: saffron, rosemary, bay leaf and mint among others.<br />

The more traditional pasta of Sardegna is <strong>malloreddus</strong>, a small gnocchi made from durum wheat semolina, salt, water and saffron. Malloreddus are served with a simple tomato sauce, a hearty lamb or sausage ragu , or with butter and grated percorino cheese. &quot;<strong>Porchetto</strong>&quot; (roasted pork) is typical of all Sardinian cuisine.<br />
