<br />
Several organizations support ECCB by granting fellowships. <br />
ISCB fellowships can be granted to students / postdocs who are ISCB members presenting a paper or a poster at the Conference.<br />
In the same way BioSapiens and EMBRACE Network of Excellence fellowships can be granted to students / postdocs presenting a paper or a poster at the Conference. <br />
ECCB volunteer fellowships can be granted to students who accept to help at the Conference (see guidelines) also without presenting any paper or poster. Grantees will be communicated the source of support and will have to acknowledge it in the paper / poster.
<p><strong>Travel and volunteer fellowships will pay for airfare (limited amount), lodging, conference registration. Fellowships will not cover affiliated expenses, such as evening meals, workshops, tutorials, conference outing.<br />
</strong><br />
<strong>Airfare:</strong> The airfare portion of the award will depend on your geographical location; the maximum amount that you will be reimbursed will be included in your award letter, and might be less than the cost of your ticket. <br />
We expect to be able to cover approximately 200 &euro; for people coming from Italy, 600 &euro; for the rest of Europe and 900 &euro; in all other cases. You will need to pay for your airfare up front, and a reimbursement check will be mailed to you approximately three weeks after the end of the conference.<br />
<br />
<strong>Lodging:</strong>    The Conference Secretariat will arrange lodging for fellowship recipients, for the duration of the meeting, with two people per room. Fellowship recipients should not make their own lodging arrangements. You will not need to pay for lodging, but you will be responsible for affiliated expenses such as phone calls from your room.</p>
<p><strong>Conference registration:</strong> Your registration fee will be reduced to 100 &euro;.</p>
<p> <strong>Meals:</strong> Breakfasts will be included with your lodging and conference registration includes lunch, so most participants will only have to pay for suppers.</p>
<p> <strong>NOTE:</strong> We intend to support as many applicants as possible. Unfortunately, because of limited funds, we will not be able to provide support to all applicants.<u> Applying for a fellowship does not guarantee that you will receive funding &ndash; if you require a fellowship in order to attend, please do not register until after you have been notified that you have received an award.<br />
