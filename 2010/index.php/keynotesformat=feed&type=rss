<p>Professor Michael Sternberg is the 
Director of the Centre for Integrative Systems Biology at Imperial 
College (CISBIC) and Centre for Bioinformatics (CfB) at Imperial College
 London and he holds the Chair of Structural Bioinformatics at Imperial.
 Michael Sternberg’s&nbsp; research interest are protein bioinformatics and 
the development of logic-based chemoinformatics. His group have 
developed the Phyre server for protein structure prediction, 3D-Garden 
for protein-protein docking, and Confunc/ 3DLigand Site for protein 
function prediction. Recent work has developed methods to analyse the 
interactome and pathways. The chemoinformatics modelling employs a 
logic-based approach and is able to learn rules relating structure to 
activity and then use these rules to identify novel active molecules.</p>]]></description>
