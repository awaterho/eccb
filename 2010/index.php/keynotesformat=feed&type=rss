and systems analysis with focus on function prediction, comparative
analysis and data integration. He has published more than 400 research
articles in international, peer-reviewed journals, among them more than
45 in Nature, Science and Cell. According to ISI (analyzing the last 10
years), dr. Bork is currently the most cited European researcher in
Molecular Biology and Genetics. He is on the editorial board of a
number of journals including Science and PloS Biology, and functions as
senior editor of the journal Molecular Systems Biology.</p><p>Dr. Bork
co-founded four biotech companies, two of which went public. More than
25 of his former associates now hold professorships or other group

<p>Professor Michael Sternberg is the 
Director of the Centre for Integrative Systems Biology at Imperial 
College (CISBIC) and Centre for Bioinformatics (CfB) at Imperial College
 London and he holds the Chair of Structural Bioinformatics at Imperial.
 Michael Sternbergâ€™s&nbsp; research interest are protein bioinformatics and 
the development of logic-based chemoinformatics. His group have 
developed the Phyre server for protein structure prediction, 3D-Garden 
for protein-protein docking, and Confunc/ 3DLigand Site for protein 
function prediction. Recent work has developed methods to analyse the 
interactome and pathways. The chemoinformatics modelling employs a 
logic-based approach and is able to learn rules relating structure to 
activity and then use these rules to identify novel active molecules.</p>]]></description>
