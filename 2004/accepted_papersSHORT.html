Follow Chemical Abstracts and its indices for chemical               names. For guidance in the use of biochemical terminology follow               the recommendations issued by the IUPAC-IUB Commission on Biochemical               Nomenclature, as given in Biochemical Nomenclature and Related Documents,               published by the Biochemical Society, UK. For enzymes, use the recommended               name assigned by the IUPAC-IUB Committee on Biochemical Nomenclature,               1978, as given in Enzyme Nomenclature, published by Academic Press,               New York, 1980. Where possible, use the recommended SI units. Genotypes               should be italicized. Phenotypes should not be italicized. For bacterial               agents nomenclature follow Demerc et al.
