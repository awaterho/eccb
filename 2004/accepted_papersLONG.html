Hard copies of figures should be sent only as               a last resort. If you must do this, please label figures lightly               on the back with number, first author and manuscript title. An arrow               should be used to indicate the top of the figure, and send them               <strong>by express mail</strong> to:</p>            <p>Veena Krishnan<br>              NewGen Imaging Systems <br>              Chennai 600041, India<br>              Tel: (00 9144) 2445 2041/2443 0996/24430676 (India)<br>              Fax: +44 (0)870 705 3303 (UK number) OR (001) 646 349 3845 (US number)<br>              email: <a href="mailto:bioinformatics@newgenimaging.com">bioinformatics@newgenimaging.com</a></p>            <p>All figures should be formatted to fit into, or be reduced to,               a single (86 mm) or double (178 mm) column width.

A minimum screen resolution               of 300 dpi at the printed size is recommended for bitmap files;               vector files (e.g. .eps) are preferable. Figures will NOT be redrawn               or relabeled.

Follow Chemical Abstracts and its indices for chemical               names. For guidance in the use of biochemical terminology follow               the recommendations issued by the IUPAC-IUB Commission on Biochemical               Nomenclature, as given in Biochemical Nomenclature and Related Documents,               published by the Biochemical Society, UK. For enzymes, use the recommended               name assigned by the IUPAC-IUB Committee on Biochemical Nomenclature,               1978, as given in Enzyme Nomenclature, published by Academic Press,               New York, 1980. Where possible, use the recommended SI units. Genotypes               should be italicized. Phenotypes should not be italicized. For bacterial               agents nomenclature follow Demerc et al. (1966) Genetics, 54, 61-76.             </p>            <p><span class="TableHeaderBlack">Page charge</span><br>              Page charges are NOT levied.</p>            <p><span class="TableHeaderBlack">Proofs</span><br>              Authors of accepted papers will be sent page proofs.
