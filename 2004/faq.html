The ISCB is dedicated to advancing the scientific                 understanding of living systems through computation, with a special                 emphasis on the role of computing and informatics in advancing                 molecular biology. The Society aims to serve its membership by                 facilitating scientific communication and raising awareness through                 meetings, tutorials, publications and by electronic means. ISCB                 membership offers many benefits including reduced conference registration                 fees and reduced subscription prices for the Journal of Computational                 Biology and Bioinformatics. Bioinformatics is the official journal                 of the society. There are currently over 1700 active members from                 42 countries including more than 300 students and trainee members.                 A member's meeting and a meeting of the Board of Directors for                 the society are held annually in conjunction with the Intelligent                 Systems for Molecular Biology (ISMB) conference. Officers are                 elected on an annual basis and serve voluntarily.               <p><span class="TableHeaderBlack"><img src="images/BotanicGardens-small.jpg" width="324" height="229" align="right">Q:                 What is the ISMB conference?</span><br>                A: ISMB (Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology) is an international                 conference sponsored by the International Society for Computational                 Biology. Over the past ten years, the ISMB conference has grown                 to become the largest bioinformatics conference in the world.                 The ISMB conferences provide a multidisciplinary forum for disseminating                 the latest developments in bioinformatics. ISMB brings together                 scientists from computer science, molecular biology, mathematics,                 and statistics. Its principal focus is on the development and                 application of advanced computational methods for biological problems.               </p>              <p><span class="TableHeaderBlack">Q: What is the ECCB?</span><br>                A:The European Conference on Computational Biology (ECCB) is a                 multi-disciplinary conference that bridges the fields of computer                 science, mathematics, physics, chemistry and biology by bringing                 together involved scientists from all over the world. It has a                 revolving scheme in which, each year, one of the European countries                 hosts the European conference, often jointly with the national                 conference on computational biology. <a href="http://www.inra.fr/eccb2003/">ECCB                 2003</a> will be held in Paris, France.</p>              <p><span class="TableHeaderBlack">Q: Why are ISMB and ECCB joined                 for 2004?</span><br>                A: By combining both conferences, we're aiming to ensure that                 no-one has to miss out.

Its mission                 is to be a research-led University operating in an international                 context with the following fundamental aims: to provide education                 through the development of learning in a research environment;                 to undertake fundamental, strategic and applied research; to sustain                 and add value to Scottish culture, to the natural environment                 and to the national economy. </p>              <p><span class="TableHeaderBlack">Q: Who are the conference chairs?</span><br>                A: ISMB/ECCB 2004 will be co-chaired by:<br>                <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Information/Staff/janet.html"><strong>Professor                 Janet Thornton, CBE, FRS</strong></a><br>                Director, <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk">EMBL - The European Bioinformatics                 Institute</a><br>                After graduating in physics, Janet Thornton studied for her PhD                 in Biophysics at the National Institute for Medical Research,                 Mill Hill, London (1970-1973). She then moved to Oxford, where                 she worked in molecular biophysics with David Phillips until 1978                 when she returned to London to the National Institute for Medical                 Research, and subsequently to a Fellowship at Birkbeck College.                 In 1990 she was appointed Professor and Director of the Biomolecular                 Structure and Modeling Unit at University College, London and                 later also was appointed to the Bernal Chair in the Crystallography                 Department at Birkbeck College. In October 2001 she became Director                 of the EMBL - European Bioinformatics Institute on the Wellcome                 Trust Genome Campus at Hinxton, near Cambridge. She was elected                 a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1999 and a Member of EMBO in                 2000, and a foreign associate of the US National Academy of Sciences                 in 2003. Janet's research focuses on structural molecular biology                 using computational approaches. Her goal is to understand biological                 processes at the molecular level, based on sequence data and the                 three-dimensional structures and interactions of the molecules                 involved. Current research is focused on understanding the evolution                 of biological function from a structural perspective and predicting                 function from structure. This includes analysis of the molecular                 interactions that provide recognition, specificity and complexity                 in biology. Such studies reveal the principles of molecular recognition                 and provide the foundations to improve the design of novel molecules                 with specific functions, for use as therapeutics.</p>              <p><a href="http://www.brc.dcs.gla.ac.uk/%7Edrg"><strong>Professor                 David Gilbert</strong></a> <br>                Professor of Bioinformatics, <a href="http://www.brc.dcs.gla.ac.uk/">Bioinformatics                 Research Centre</a>, <a href="http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk">Department                 of Computing Science</a>, <a href="http://www.gla.ac.uk">University                 of Glasgow</a><br>                David Gilbert holds an MSc and PhD in Computing from Imperial                 College, London where his research focused on parallel computing.
