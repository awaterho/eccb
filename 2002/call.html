<br>
The ECCB conference provides an outstanding opportunity to present
cutting edge research in Computational Biology.
It is a multi-disciplinary conference
that bridges the field of computer science, molecular
biology, biochemistry, pharmaceutics, and medicine 
by bringing together involved scientists from all over the world.
ECCB 2002 marks the start of a revolving scheme, in which each year, 
another of the national computational biology conferences (France, UK,
Scandinavia, etc.) plays the role of the European conference.
<BR><BR>
Papers reporting on original research 
in all areas of computational molecular
biology are sought, including surveys of important recent
results/directions.
<br><br>
Typical but not exclusive topics of interest include development
and application of advanced computational methods for biological
problems including computational techniques such as

<H2>PROCEEDINGS</H2>
The proceedings will be published as a supplement to the Journal
Bioinformatics (Oxford University Press). They will be distributed at the
conference and will be available to subscribers of the journal online via
the OUP website after the conference. Authors of accepted papers will be
strongly encouraged to use the <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.zbi-saar.de/ECCB2002/download/bioinfclass.zip  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by BackStreet browser, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Project.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.zbi-saar.de/ECCB2002/download/bioinfclass.zip'">
Latex templates</a> provided by OUP for preparation 
of the final version of the paper.
<H2>NOTIFICATION</H2>
All submissions will be reviewed by several members of the ECCB 2002 Program Committee.
Authors will be notified of acceptance or rejection by
mail. A final copy of each accepted paper will be required
subsequently. An author of each accepted paper is expected to attend
the conference and present the paper; otherwise alternative
arrangements should be made to have the paper presented.
All accepted papers will appear in the published proceedings
that will be available at the time of the conference.
<H2>MANUSCRIPT PREPARATION</H2>
A manuscript should start with a succinct statement of the problem,
the results achieved, their significance and a comparison with
previous work.  This material should be understandable to
non-specialists. A technical exposition directed to the specialist
should follow. The length, excluding cover page and bibliography,
should not exceed 12 pages. The manuscript should be easy to read,
using at least 11 point font size on letter format.
If authors believe that more details
are absolutely necessary to substantiate the claims of the paper, they
may include a clearly marked appendix. An email address for the
contact author should be included. 
Manuscripts that deviate significantly from these guidelines risk rejection without
consideration of their merits.
<br>
We provide templates for Latex, which can be downloaded

Authors are strongly urged to use these templates.  Only if you do not
have access to Latex, you should consider to use another format (pdf, ps).
<H2>MANUSCRIPT SUBMISSION</H2>
Send your manuscript via e-mail to <a href="mailto:ECCB2002@bioinf.uni-sb.de">ECCB2002@bioinf.uni-sb.de</a>
You will receive confirmation of receipt (or notification that the manuscript was
unprintable) within a day. Your confirmation will go to
the e-mail address from which the manuscript was sent. Please contact
us if you do not hear from us. 
<BR><BR>
To be considered, your submission must conform to these simple
rules.  The file must be an e-mail attachment, not embedded in the
body of the message.  The file format must be PostScript or PDF. The
printed manuscript must contain the e-mail and street address of the
corresponding author.
<br><br>
With submitting a manuscript to ECCB 2002, the authors guarantee that
they will present the paper at the conference in the case that it is
accepted. ECCB 2002 does not allow multiple submission of the same
manuscript to other conferences.
<BR><BR>
The following suggestions are recommendations only. Your file
should be small because files over a few megabytes may not survive
e-mail. Your file should be compressed, preferably with bzip2, gzip,
compress or zip. Compression reduces the size of your e-mail message,
and provides us with a simple test for e-mail corruption.
<H2>POSTERS</H2>
ECCB 2002 will include a poster session. Accepted posters will
appear in a special poster book. Poster submission
instructions will be posted on this web site. 
<H2>VENUE</H2>
Saarbr&uuml;cken is located in the heart of Europe close to Germany's
borders with France and Luxembourg. Information technology,
biotechnology and knowledge management are being promoted as the
major platforms for future development and growth of the region.
<BR><BR>
The conference itself will take place in Saarbr&uuml;cken's Congress Hall which
is located in the city center.
<H2>EXCURSIONS </H2>
There will be an excursion to the
