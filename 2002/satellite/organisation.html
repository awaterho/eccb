<br>Dear Participant,
<br>
<br>we thank you for your interest in the  Workshop "Bioinformatics and Statistical Physics" which  will be held in Saarbrücken October 10-11, 2002. We now have 150 registered participants, which is about twice as many as we were originally expecting.
<br>
<br>This clearly proves the interest in enhancing the communication between Statistical Physicists and Bioinformatics Researchers. We hope to achieve this by providing a forum for a two-day intensive discussion on  topics and methods at the intersection of the research interests of both communities.
<br>
<br>The program and the book of abstract is now available at <a target=_blanc href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.zbi.uni-saarland.de/ECCB2002/satellite/program.pdf  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by BackStreet browser, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Project.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.zbi.uni-saarland.de/ECCB2002/satellite/program.pdf'">http://www.zbi.uni-saarland.de/ECCB2002/satellite/program.pdf</a>
<br>
<br>The workshop will be held at the Department of Computer Science, building n.45, in the Lecture Hall in the Basement Room 002. Due to the number of participants we had to switch from the Max-Planck-Institute for Computer Science next door. 
<br>
<br>An interactive campus map can be found at <a target=_blanc href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.uni-saarland.de/verwalt/UniMap/uni-sb.html  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by BackStreet browser, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Project.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.uni-saarland.de/verwalt/UniMap/uni-sb.html'">http://www.uni-saarland.de/verwalt/UniMap/uni-sb.html</a>.
<br>
<br>For details on how to reach the Saarland University main campus please consult the webpage <a target=_blanc href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.uni-saarland.de  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by BackStreet browser, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Project.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.uni-saarland.de'">http://www.uni-saarland.de</a> and for general information on Saarbrücken see <a target=_blanc href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.saarbruecken.de  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by BackStreet browser, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Project.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.saarbruecken.de'">http://www.saarbruecken.de</a> which also contains an online map of the city. If you arrive to the campus by bus from the city the best stop is the "Universitaet Mensa" in front of the building n.32. Not all buses stop there, the main campus stop is however at about  5 min walks from the workshop site. Information on buses and  timetables can be found at <a target=_blanc href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.saarbahn.de/fahrplan.html  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by BackStreet browser, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Project.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.saarbahn.de/fahrplan.html'">http://www.saarbahn.de/fahrplan.html</a> Bus tickets can be bought on board at the price of 1.70 Euros.
<br>
<br>For those of you coming by car: the entrance by car to the campus is allowed only for members of the Saarland University holding a special tag. Please leave the car outside the main campus entrance (Haupteinfahrt) in the visitors parking lot. The lecture hall is reached by a 10 min. walk from there.
<br>
<br>We will have coffee and lunch breaks. Coffee will be served in the Lobby of the Max-Planck-Institute for Computer Science  (building n.46). For lunch there are several options. There is a  nearby small restaurant (The Stuhlsatzenhaus), a 10 minutes walk away just off campus beyond the building n.37. 
<br>
<br>The Campus Mensa (building n. 28 in the map) is about 5 minutes by foot from the lecture room. Attendees who want to eat at the Mensa have to buy a token during the morning coffee break. For the price of 5 Euros, a meal with a drink can be selected from the menu. Alternatively, in the mensa building there is also a restaurant (no token is needed for this case).
<br>
<br>We hope for a successful meeting and are looking forward  to seeing you soon in Saarbrücken,
<br>
<br>
<br>The organizers

<br>----------------- ADVICE FOR SPEAKERS ---------------------------------
<br>
<br>Be aware that the attendees' background may be very different from  yours. Try to be simple and clear, avoid too much terminology. Focus on ideas, concepts, results, their meaning and relevance. The time available for each speaker does not allow for expositions in technical detail.
