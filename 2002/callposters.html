<br>
The ECCB conference provides an outstanding opportunity to present
cutting edge research in Computational Biology.
It is a multi-disciplinary conference
that bridges the field of computer science, molecular
biology, biochemistry, pharmaceutics, and medicine 
by bringing together involved scientists from all over the world.
ECCB 2002 marks the start of a revolving scheme, in which each year, 
another of the national computational biology conferences (France, UK,
Scandinavia, etc.) plays the role of the European conference.
<BR><BR>
Posters reporting on original research 
in all areas of computational molecular
biology are sought, including surveys of important recent
results/directions.
<br><br>
Typical but not exclusive topics of interest include development
and application of advanced computational methods for biological
problems including computational techniques such as
