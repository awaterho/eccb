We are interested in quantifying the contribution of lateral gene 
transfer, innovation, loss, expansion and rearrangements to the evolution 
of microbial genomes. Here, we discuss the results of pair-wise genome 
comparisons of closely related species, including our own recently 
obtained genome sequence data. We compare architectural divergence to 
nucleotide sequence divergence for microbes with different lifestyles. A 
particular focus is on comparisons of the recently obtained 1.6 Mb and 1.9 
Mb genome sequences of Bartonella henselae and Bartonella quintana, the 
vector-borne agents of cat-scratch disease and trench fever, respectively. 
We show that the B. quintana genome is a smaller subset of the B. henselae 
genome. As observed for many pathogens, the main difference between 
closely related strains and species resides in the content of phage genes 
and pathogenicity islands. This flexibility in genome structure contrasts 
with the extreme stability observed in the small genomes of aphid 
endosymbionts, in which no rearrangements or inflow of genetic material 
have occurred during the past 50 millions years (1). We discuss the 
results of large-scale phylogenomic analyses of these genomes and their 
relationships to free-living bacteria and mitochondria. Our data suggests 
that the degree of genomic stability correlate with the genomic content of 
repeated sequences and movable genetic elements, and thereby with 
bacterial lifestyle.<br><br>
