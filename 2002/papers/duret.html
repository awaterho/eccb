    	<td>Large scale experiments of gene inactivation in yeast have shown that 50% 
of genes have no detectable impact on the phenotype, and similar 
observations have been made in other model organisms. This apparent paradox 
is probably due to the fact that many genes only have a marginal 
contribution to the fitness of organisms. Because of the size of 
populations and the number of generations that can be studied in 
laboratories, experimental approaches only permit to detect functional 
elements that have a strong phenotypic impact. Comparative sequence 
analysis can help to solve this problem : the analysis of sequences 
evolution permits to detect the action of selection, and hence to reveal 
functional features of genomes. This approach will be illustrated by the 
study of synonymous codon usage in animals and plants. </td></tr>
