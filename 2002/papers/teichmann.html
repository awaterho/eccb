    	<td>In the postgenomic era, one of the most interesting and important
 challenges is to
 understand protein interactions on a large scale. The physical
interactions
 between
 protein domains are fundamental to the workings of a cell: in multi-domain
 polypeptide
 chains, in multi-subunit proteins and in transient complexes between
 proteins that also
 exist independently. Thus experimental investigation of protein-protein
 interactions has
 been extensive, including recent large-scale screens using mass
 spectrometry.<br>
 The role of computational research on protein-protein interactions
 encompasses
 not only prediction, but also understanding the nature of the interactions
 and their three-
 dimensional structures.  I will discuss properties such as sequence
 conservation and co-
 regulation of genes and proteins involved in different types of physical
 interactions.
 Given that all proteins consist of their evolutionary units, the domains,
 all interactions
 occur between these domains. The interactions between domains belonging to
 different
 protein families will be the second topic of my talk.</td></tr>
